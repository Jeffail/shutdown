Shutdown
========

This is a Go package providing a mechanism for signalling two-tier shutdown mechanics in asynchronous components.

This package is "complete" in the sense that no further development work is planned and any PRs proposing to expand its scope will be rejected. However, please continue to report bugs and feel free to raise PRs to address them.
